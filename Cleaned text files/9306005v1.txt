Prediction and Adaptation in an Evolving Chaotic Environment


Introduction


In recent years various examples of complex adaptive systems, such as
neural nets *REF*, genetic
algorithms *REF*, *REF*, and evolutionary
models including artificial life *REF* have been
used in carrying out computational optimizations. In addition adaptive
algorithms and evolutionary models have been used to mimic the
evolution of biological and social systems *REF*,
*REF*, *REF*. When used for the prediction of
a complex dynamics common features, such as a tendency to evolve
their internal dynamics to the edge of chaos *REF*,
*REF*, *REF*, *REF* and the
emergence of adaptive predictors with a bounded rationality or a
limited memory *REF* have been observed in many of
those systems. However it is typical for the systems which have been
studied that they have many parameters and often their properties
depend sensitively on the adjustment of those parameters
*REF*.


As a first step toward the development of an approach which
incorporates a quantitative understanding of common features of
complex adaptive systems, we have carried out computer simulations
of a simple &quot;toy model&quot; of a complex adaptive system: individual
agents, operating in an evolving chaotic environment specified by a
logistic map, seek to predict the future states of their environment
by modeling and controlling it. We study the dynamics of adaptive
predictive agents responding to an evolving chaotic environment and to
one another. Our simulations are designed to quantify adaptation and
to explore co-adaptation for a simple calculable model of a complex
adaptive system.


Although elementary, and in large part calculable, our adaptive agents
(predictors) meet the definition of a complex adaptive system proposed
by Murray Gell-Mann *REF*:
- information gathering entities
- respond both to the environment and to one another
- segregate information from random noise
- compress regularities into a model (schema)
- modify their internal characteristics to improve their predictive
(adaptive) capacity.


In our model the chaotic environment to which an agent responds is
specified by a simple logistic map, with parameters which can be
altered, plus random or dynamic noise which can also be altered. A
given agent may be either passive or active; thus agents both respond
to the environment (by receiving signals from it) and attempt to
control it (by sending signals to it)*REF*. More
specifically, an agent measures and models the chaotic environment
and employs various control strategies to predict its future states.
For each agent we give explicit quantitative measures of:
- adaptation (the predictive ability of the agent)
- complexity (the number of parameters used to specify an agent&apos;s
model)
- memory (the data used in the modelling process).


We determine both experimentally (via our computer simulations) and
analytically the conditions for optimal predictive behavior
(adaptation), complexity, memory.


We first consider the ability of a single agent, exposed to a chaotic
environment, to model, control, and predict the future states of
that environment. We then introduce a second agent which, in
attempting to model and control both the chaotic environment and the
first agent, modifies the extent to which that agent can identify
patterns and exercise control.


Our computer simulations demonstrate the consequences of competition
between the two agents. Competition leads to chaos, if the agents
follow typical learning strategies, or to emergent metastable
behavior, if the agents develop a new learning strategy. Thus, we find
metastable solutions (strategies) in which the two agents optimize
their joint predictive capacities by co-adapting in a leader-follower
relationship. A sufficient condition for arriving at this joint
strategy is the development of adaptive predictions which enable one
agent to recognize the presence of another. Our results suggest a
correlation between optimal adaptation, optimal complexity, and emergent behavior. 
Preliminary support is provided for the concept of
optimal co-adaptation near an order-disorder
transition *REF*, *REF*,
*REF*, *REF*.


The computer simulations were performed on a Silicon Graphics 340 VGX
machine. The length of time for a given study varies from 1000 time
steps (the number required to determine numerically the optimal
response of a single agent) to 100,000 time steps (the number required
to explore in detail


the competition between two active agents which leads, over time, to
their arriving at dynamic controls near the edge of chaos). For two
agents, each time step required 2 sec of cpu time.


In Sec. 2 we specify our model, and consider the behavior of a single
agent. We consider competition (and cooperation) between two agents in
Sec 3. Extensions and possible applications are discussed in Sec 4.


2. Systems with One Agent


2.1 The Dynamics of the Environment


The use of a simple logistic map to describe a typical high
dimensional complex environment may be considered an
oversimplification. However, there is a long history of similar
approaches in studies of physical systems.


Most physical systems are in reality high dimensional systems. A
physical pendulum, often used as an example of low dimensional motion,
has many degrees of freedom. When stimulated by a short kick, such as
the impact of an hammer, many kinds of vibrations may be stimulated.
Usually those vibrations die out fast, which means that the dynamics
settles down to a low dimensional approximate inertial manifold.
Often, the trajectories are complicated but confined to a very small
region on this approximate inertial manifold. If the inertial manifold
and the flow vector field are smooth in this region, one may expand
the flow vector field in a Taylor series and drop higher order terms.
In this case, the limiting dynamics is low dimensional and the
nonlinearity of the corresponding flow vector field is of low order.
Lorenz has shown *REF* that low
dimensional, low order systems can exhibit deterministic chaos, i.e.
irregular motion which is sensitive to initial conditions. Since the
flow vector field of such systems is smooth, their dynamics is usually
smooth and oscillatory with trajectories which may have a simple or
fractal geometry *REF*, *REF*. Moreover,
Poincare *REF* has shown that it is in general useful
to study the dynamics of the amplitudes of the smooth oscillatory
motion of a low dimensional, low order system and to model it with low
order maps. Therefore, we model the environment with logistic map
dynamics, a simple, nontrivial deterministic chaotic system.


In many systems of interest, noise is present and the control
parameters vary over time. We thus wish to consider environments in
which additive background noise is present, and in which the control
parameter is noisy: *MATH*. We assume that the rate of
change of the control parameter of the environment is small, i.e.
*MATH*. Fig. *REF* illustrates the dynamics of such
an environment.


The Dynamics of the Agent


1.Prediction, Adaptation, Learning, and Innovation


In our numerical experiments, the primary goal of each agent is
prediction of the environment to which it and, where present, other
possible agents are responding. An agent seeks to discover patterns or
regularities in the environment; this process
of constructing a model of the environment is greatly facilitated if
the agent has the option of turning on or off a control signal which
may entrain the environmental dynamics to a predetermined sequence of
states, defined as the goal dynamics of the agent, a process of active
adaptation. As we shall see, by pursuing a reasonably well defined
strategy, a single agent can arrive at a goal dynamics which maximizes
its predictive power.


A given agent samples a set of N n successive events *MATH*, which characterize the time
evolution of the environment and uses it to predict the next m events, *MATH*. The success of the
prediction process of the agent is measured by the prediction error, *MATH*
defined with respect to the background noise level, *MATH*, as: 


The prediction error is a sliding average of length M over an ensemble
of rapidly fluctuating values. It depends on the time of prediction,
n, and the number of steps predicted, m. The best prediction is
limited by the background noise level *MATH*;. From Eq.
*REF* the minimum value of the prediction error is 1.


At each step n, the agent can modify its model. This process of
modification, or updating, represents the adaptive behavior of the
agent. For our adaptive agents, learning is a two step process:
- first, acquire and apply a predetermined class of schemata or fitting
functions to model the past events of the environment.
- second, choose fitting function parameters that do the best job of
prediction.


In the present context, innovation involves the development and application of a new and different class of models to analyze the past and
predict the future. It may include active adaptation, an exploration
of the response of the environment to an imposed goal dynamics.
We assume that the time scale of the innovation process is in general
longer than the time scale of the learning process N n. We also
assume that the probability an agent decides to try to improve a
parameter of the modelling and control processes is given by: *MATH*.


Here c (a constant) is the minimum rate of adaptation and Ç« n,m,M 
is the current m step prediction error of the agent averaged over
M time steps. The minimum rate of adaptation, c, may be different
for each parameter of the modelling and control processes. Typical
values of c are such that *MATH*.



The agent begins with a given initial setting of the model and control
processes and observes the environment for at least N n time steps.
It then calculates an initial model and updates the model and
prediction error at each subsequent time step. In addition, at each
time step, the agent selects a random number, R, which lies between
0 and 1. If *MATH*, the agent does nothing; if *MATH* the
agent innovates. With this procedure, the probability that an agent
will innovate is simply P n, as long as P n 1. Whenever *MATH*, 
the agent will always innovate. Thus after, say, t time steps
the agent will innovate, i.e. try another class of fitting
functions, switch the control on, or alter the goal dynamics. t is
short if the prediction error is large and vice versa according to
Eq *REF*. The expectation value of t is *MATH*.
Eq *REF* also guarantees perpetual novelty; no matter how
well an agent is doing, that agent will, sooner or later, be prompted
to innovate. For optimally predictive agents, whose prediction error
is of order unity, the minimum rate of innovation is c. The trial period for innovation is assumed to last 2M steps.
After that period the parameter is reset to its previous value if the
prediction error has increased on average during the last M steps of
the trial period.


2.Learning: Modeling and Prediction


An agent develops a model, f^model^, of the environmental dynamics
for single and multiple step predictions of the environment FORMULA
where FORMULA and where FORMULA counts
the number of steps. This is based on the assumption that a good
predictor for the observed events is a good predictor for future
events.


The first step of the modelling process is for the agent to represent
the observed events in a state space (see Fig *REF*).
In the simulations, we restrict the attention of each agent to events
that lie within a region of interest, a range of events such that FORMULA 
are the boundaries of the region of interest at time step n. In modeling the
environmental dynamics each agent uses those N n events which are
most recent and in which the initial state is in the region of
interest. In our numerical examples the region of interest is usually
slightly larger than the region where events have been observed during
the first 1000 time steps of each simulation. Further we introduce a 
equidistant grid FORMULA and estimate FORMULA
the events FORMULA at these grid points through linear
interpolation *REF* (see Fig. *REF*). The interpolation represents a
generalization of the observed events, since the agent is guessing the 
behavior of the environment
for those states where no observations are available.


The relation between y^grid^ and f^grid^ is represented by a
Fourier series: FORMULA where d^model^ and d^model^ are parameters of the Fourier analysis
chosen to improve the convergence of the Fourier series. Unless we specify
otherwise, we assume that the observed events are almost homogeneously
distributed in the region of interest, and that interpolation errors
are small compared to statistical errors. In this case the standard deviation Ï p k of
the Fourier coefficients is given by FORMULA.


The last step of the modeling process is to compress the information
which is contained in the generalized observed events by segregating
information from random noise. The values of the model parameters
p^model^ are determined by a least-squares fit which minimizes the prediction error
by minimizing the difference between the generalized events at zero
noise level and a model for single step predictions (Eq.
*REF*) for the observed events. If we assume that the
observed states are homogeneously distributed in the region of interest, 
that the additive noise is uncorrelated and that the rate
of change of the environment is small, the fit problem has a unique
solution and the optimal parameters p^model^ are given given by the Fourier
coefficients pË^model^ of f^grid^ *REF*, or are equal to zero, if the
Fourier coefficient is smaller than its standard deviation Ï p k.
An analogous procedure, pruning, is followed in neural nets, where it
is found to improve their performance *REF*. If we
define complexity, K n, as the number of model parameters used by
the agent, it is possible to determine the complexity K^opt^ of an
optimal model. The optimal model neglects all parameters with value
smaller than the error bar for that parameter, estimated by its
standard deviation. This concept is illustrated in Fig.
*REF*. The minimum prediction error in Fig.
*REF* is at approximately k = 10. In Fig.
*REF* the Fourier coefficients equal the error bar also
at k = 10. The optimal complexity is small for a large rate of
change of the environment and vice versa.


The environmental dynamics is a parabolic function with only one
parameter. Therefore, a Tschebycheff series or a Legendre series
would converge even faster than the Fourier series since these are
also polynomial. However we intentionally
program the agents to use a Fourier series in order to illustrate
the point that an exact match between the set of models (schemata) and
environmental dynamics is not necessary.


The Fourier coefficients of many continuous, piecewise linear
functions converge parabolically *REF*, i.e. FORMULA, with an appropriate choice FORMULA.
The prediction error for an agent with complexity K n can be
estimated by writing FORMULA where m = 1, 2,... and where FORMULA.


Another quantity which can be optimized by an agent is the number N n 
of states of the environment which are used in the modelling process. In
principle, an agent is assumed to have access to the whole history of
the environmental dynamics. In practice, the agent will find it
advantageous to use only a small portion of this information. Since
N n measures how much of this information is used for the modeling
process, N n is a measure for the memory of the agent. If N n is
large, outdated data may decrease the quality of the model. If N n 
is too small, statistical errors may prevent an agent from choosing an
optimal description. Therefore, there is an optimal memory N^opt^ of
an agent, which strikes a balance between the errors introduced by the
noise level and those produced by the rate of change of the
environment. Fig. *REF* shows how a proper choice of
N n minimizes the prediction error.


The last term of Eq.1 *REF* increases with the rate of
change of the environment Ï p and N n. Since the first term in
Eq. *REF* decreases with N n, the prediction error
Ç« n,l is minimal for FORMULA as depicted in Fig. *REF*. Agents with optimal memory and
optimal complexity possess a prediction error, FORMULA.


The noise level in the environment and the rate of change of the environment determine the optimal memory of the agent. 
If the Fourier series converges parabolically the optimal complexity of the agent
with optimal memory is: FORMULA.


Since N n data are used to fit the model, a delay of N n time
steps is needed to model the environment after a sudden change of the
parameter p n. Therefore, it is possible to establish a relation
between the complexity of the agent&apos;s model and the learning rate, the
minimum time required to extract a completely new model from the
environmental dynamics. This result provides a method to determine
experimentally whether an adaptive agent is functioning optimally. To evaluate an agent&apos;s performance an observer
can introduce a sudden change of the environment and then measure the
recovery of an adaptive agent, as shown in Fig *REF*. A
match between the recovery rate and the optimal learning rate
indicates that the agent is optimally adapted. An important feature of
the modeling process is that the resulting model parameters are
unique. If the relation between the evolving control parameters of
the environmental dynamics and the model parameters is continuous, it
may be possible to apply the same modeling procedure to the time
series of the model parameters and to construct hierarchical models,
of the kind considered by Crutchfield *REF*.


3.Control of the Environment


The process just described represents passive adaptive behavior of the
agent. However, an agent can modify the environment in an effort to
improve his predictive power, by turning on or off a control signal,
which may entrain the environmental dynamics to a particular goal
dynamics. Our control strategy for such an active agent is based on
the approach developed by one of us *REF* for the
control of chaos. The agent applies a suitably chosen driving force to
entrain the chaotic environment to a predetermined goal dynamics.


There is a close relation between entrainment and optimal prediction.
Entrained oscillators may have an optimal energy exchange since they
are at resonance *REF* while the concept of optimal
information transfer has widespread application in research on phase
locked loops *REF*, *REF*. As we shall
see, for the problem at hand entrainment makes optimal prediction
possible.


To control the environmental dynamics an active adaptive agent
iterates a logistic map time series x n of desired environmental
states; this goal dynamics is specified by a parameter p^goal^: FORMULA
to impose the goal dynamics on the environment, the agent applies a
driving force; FORMULA tailored to make up the difference between the agent&apos;s model of the
uncontrolled environmental dynamics and the desired state of the
environment.


The resulting controlled environment dynamics is given by: FORMULA.


Control is advantageous. It enables the agent to avoid the exponential
growth of the prediction error with the number of steps, found in the
case of chaotic systems with positive Liapunov exponents (see Fig.
*REF* and Fig *REF*). If the agent succeeds in
controlling the environment, the prediction error becomes bounded; the
upper boundary becomes small if the control which is exercised is
stable over long periods of time. For an example of the way in which
control reduces the prediction error, see Fig *REF*.


The type of the goal dynamics has both a direct and indirect impact on
the prediction error. Since the size of prediction error depends on
the stability of the control, an agent may improve the prediction
error by choosing a goal dynamics which provides a very stable
control. From this point of view, the prediction error would be as
small as possible if the goal dynamics is, or is close to a stationary
state, or some other superstable stationary
orbit *REF* of the unperturbed system.


However, this discussion takes only statistical errors into account.
If the goal dynamics is a stationary state, for example at x n =
0.5, the interpolation procedure may lead to large systematic
errors. This is illustrated in Fig. *REF*. There we assume
the region of interest is the whole interval and that f is known at
the boundaries of the interval. Fig. *REF* a shows that the
prediction error may be significantly higher than the statistical
estimate as long as the goal dynamics is not chaotic, i.e. p n 
3.56. This is because the linear interpolation produces edges which
are very sharp for stationary states close to x n = 0.5 (Fig.
*REF*b), much less sharp for period two dynamics, and
essentially absent for a chaotic goal dynamics. Of course, other
interpolation schemes could weaken this effect, but the best solution
to this problem is to pick a chaotic or random goal dynamics which
covers the entire state space and makes interpolations unnecessary.
Likewise, a small amount of additive noise in the environmental
dynamics or the goal dynamics may help to reduce the prediction
error, since it reduces systematic errors in the modelling
process *REF*. Moreover a control with a chaotic goal
dynamics makes the system more robust against sudden changes in the
noise level, since the agent has a global model of the flow vector
field.


Systems with two Agents


As might be expected, the results change dramatically when two agents
are present. For example, a second agent may alter the environmental
dynamics of the first agent sufficiently to make it impossible for the
latter to exercise effective control and make accurate predictions.
Or, without establishing direct communication, one agent may identify
the presence of a second, and the two may establish a cooperative
relationship which improves their joint predictive abilities.


We assume that the agents have the same region of interest but may
have different goal dynamics, and different models of the
environmental dynamics. To distinguish between the parameters of the
two agents, we attach a superscript a = 1, 2 to the model parameters p^model,a^, the
memory N^a^, the n n complexity, K^a^, the parameter of the goal dynamics p^a^, the
ON/OFF switch n n of the control, C^a^, the Liapunov exponent of the goal dynamics
Î»^g,a^, the n n control coefficient Î»^c,a^, the prediction error Ç«^a^ and the
control force F^a^.


The dynamics of the environmental system is then given by: FORMULA.


In the following we discuss the prediction errors of the two agents
for the situation where both are passive, i.e. both have their
control switched off, both are active, i.e. both have their control
switched on, and the leader follower situation, in which one is active
(leader) and one is passive(follower). We study the lifetime of those
structures, i.e. the number of time steps between the start and end
of such a configuration, where trial periods do not count as the end
of a configuration if this configuration reemerges after the trial
period. Unless we specify otherwise, we assume that both agents have a
memory and complexity which would be optimal for single agent systems.
There are three scenarios for dual agent behavior: both may be
passive; one may be passive while the other is active, i.e. exercises
control to improve its predictive power, a leader-follower situation;
or both may be active, vying for control (and optimal predictive
power). We consider these scenarios in turn, assuming that each agent
is capable of optimizing its memory and complexity in response to an
environment in which the other agent is absent.


Two Passive Agents


When both agents are passive, the prediction error of each will be as
though the other agent were not present. For a chaotic environmental
dynamics the prediction error is usually very large compared to the
leader follower situation. Following a trial period, one or the other
agent will turn on its control, and the scenario becomes one of leader
(the active agent) and follower (the passive agent).


The life time of a configuration with two passive agents may be
estimated by: FORMULA.


where the prediction errors are the same as of single passive agents.
For a chaotic environment, passive agents have a large prediction
error. Therefore the lifetime of a configuration with two passive
agents is quite short.


The Leader - Follower Relation


As long as the second agent remains passive, the scenario for the
behavior of the first agent, the leader, is identical to that of a
single agent. The leader explores various controls, entrains the
environment, and improves his predictive power. However, as this
process of active adaptation proceeds, the passive second agent, the
follower, senses a changed environment. If the leader switches off its
control infrequently, the follower will see an environment which is
mainly determined by the goal dynamics of the control exercised by the
leader. Such a controlled environment is easier to predict as long as
the goal dynamics of the leader is not chaotic. Under these circumstances, 
the optimal memory of the follower may, in fact, exceed that
of the leader, whose memory depends on both the noise level and rate
of change of the environment. The results of our numerical experiments
on the role played by the goal dynamics of the leader are displayed in
Fig *REF*.


In the leader-follower situation, where one agent is active and one
agent is passive, the prediction error can be estimated by: FORMULA
for the follower. The lifetime of the leader follower configuration
can be estimated by: FORMULA where p^min^ and p^max^ are the boundaries of the parameter range.
The second term in Eq.2*REF* increases for larger p^1^
whereas the first term decreases sharply when the goal dynamics
becomes chaotic at p^1^ = 3.56. Therefore the lifetime of the configuration has a maximum close 
to p^1^ = 3.56, the edge of chaos (See Fig.1 *REF*). This means that if the leader chooses a
simple periodic goal dynamics, it is very likely that he will be
successfully challenged by the follower, since the probability is high
that the goal dynamics of the follower is more complicated than the
goal dynamics of the leader. However, if the goal dynamics of the
leader is highly chaotic, than the follower will also challenge the
leader often since the follower&apos;s prediction error is poor.
Eq.2 *REF* is only a rough estimate since it does not
account for the periodic windows


*REF* of the logistic map dynamics, which are
important at low noise levels *REF*. The passive agent
will eventually try to improve his predictions by switching on a
control; when he does, the environment will follow his goal only if it
is more complicated than the goal of the agent which is already
active. For example if the active agent entrains the environment to a
period four dynamics by using a period four driving force, the other
agent cannot disentrain the environment to a period two dynamics
with a period two driving force, since a period two entrainment would
be disturbed by the period four driving force of the first agent. 
However if the second agent tries to
entrain the environment to a period eight dynamics, this may be stable
if the period four driving force of the first agent is taken into
account by the second agent. Another situation arises if the goal
dynamics of the follower is chaotic. It is then difficult to
compensate the periodic driving force of the leader and the
environment does not entrain with the follower during the trial
period.


An overview of situations in which it is advantageous for the follower
to become active is given in Fig.1 *REF*. In region A the
follower has a more complicated dynamics than the leader. Therefore
it can entrain the environment successfully and does not increase its
prediction error by becoming active. In region B the goal dynamics
of the follower is simple compared to that of the leader. The
prediction error increases significantly if the follower becomes
active. In region C the goal dynamics of the follower is chaotic and
usually does not lead to entrainment of the environment. Therefore it
is not advantageous for the follower to switch on its control in
regions B or C. In the region D the goal dynamics of the leader
is chaotic. This leads to very large prediction errors for the
follower and makes control for the follower almost always
advantageous. If the leader chooses a goal dynamics at the edge of
chaos, i.e. p^1^ â 3.56, the probability that the follower would
become active is minimized, since regions B and C contain the entire range of
p^2^ values.


Therefore the leader follower-relation is most stable for a goal
dynamics at the edge of chaos. If we assume that the challenge of the follower is successful if the
complexity of its goal dynamics is larger than that of the leader,
the lifetime of the leader-follower relation increases as p^1^ increases. However
as soon as the goal dynamics of the leader becomes chaotic the prediction error
of the follower rises sharply. This shortens the time span between two
trial periods of the follower and makes it much more likely that the
follower challenges the leader successfully. Therefore the lifetime of
the leader follower configuration has a maximum for parameters which are close to p^1^ â
3.56, the edge of chaos. As may be seen in Fig.1 *REF*, our numerical
studies indicate that leader-follower configuration at the edge of
chaos is the most stable among all configurations including those
where both agents are active, or both are passive.


Since a leader follower configuration with a goal dynamics at the edge
of chaos possesses a long lifetime, this configuration may be
considered as an emerging structure. Despite the fact that no social
aspects are included in the system, since both agents only seek to optimize their own
prediction error, a structure with social aspects emerges, in which
one of the agents takes the lead and the other agent follows the moves
of the leader.


Two Active Agents


As noted above, the second agent will not remain passive, no matter
how well he predicts his environment. He will, in time, switch on his
controls in an attempt to improve his prediction powers. The system
dynamics, for the general case of two active agents, with different
goal dynamics, is complicated. If both agents use a control dynamics
with a positive exponent, it leads to hyperchaos. While it is
difficult to estimate analytically the prediction errors and
configuration lifetimes, we observe in our numerical experiments that
the resulting system dynamics settles into a state in which the
environmental dynamics follows very closely one of the two imposed
goal dynamics, in general the one which is more complicated (see
Fig.1 *REF*). Thus, if the goal dynamics of one agent is a
stationary state, while the goal dynamics of the other agent is a
period two dynamics, the environmental dynamics would follow the
period two dynamics. If one agent uses a highly chaotic goal dynamics,
for example p^1^ = 4 and the other agent a less chaotic goal dynamics, for
example p^2^ = 3.6, then the environment follows the first agent&apos;s goal.
This &quot;competition principle&quot; would suggest that the agent with the
more complicated goal dynamics has a good chance to outperform his
competitor, as illustrated in Fig.1*REF*. We also observe
that the driving force of the unsuccessful competitor tends to
approach a constant, even if its goal dynamics is not stationary.


In this winner-loser configuration, the prediction error of the
successful competitor is the same as for an active agent without any
competitor, whereas the prediction error of the unsuccessful
competitor is significantly larger. The difference between the two
prediction errors can be estimated by the average difference of the
goal dynamics of the two agents.


If both agents are active, with one emerging as a successful
competitor, the other as a unsuccessful competitor, a rough estimate
of the prediction error for the successful competitor(winner), labeled
here as the first agent is given by: FORMULA for the unsuccessful competitor(loser).


The prediction error of the winner is the same as for a single active
agent, whereas the prediction error of the loser is generally
dominated by a term which measures the average difference between the
two goal dynamics. The lifetime L n,m of this configuration can be
estimated from the equation, FORMULA. 


Since the unsuccessful competitor can usually improve his prediction
error by switching his control off, the lifetime of the winner-loser
configuration depends only on time span between two trial periods of
the loser, and is determined by the prediction error of the
unsuccessful competitor. The loser may be considered to be maladapted
since his goal dynamics is too simple. In this case the maladapted
agent would lose the competition. Preliminary results indicate that
other types of maladaptation, such as suboptimal memory or suboptimal
complexity, may also lead an agent to lose the competition.


Our preliminary studies also indicate that time span required before
the winner-loser configuration emerges from a state where both agents
are active increases with the Liapunov exponent of the goal dynamics
of the successful competitor. This observation suggests that an agent
that has a slightly more complicated goal dynamics than his competitor
has the best chance for a rapid improvement of his prediction error.


Adaptation to the Edge of Chaos


A scenario for transitions between successive configurations is
presented in Fig.1*REF*. It takes the following form:
- first configuration: two passive agents
- second configuration: One agent switches on its control and becomes
the leader; the prediction error of both agents typically goes down.
One thus arrives at the leader-follower configuration.


While comparatively stable, the leader-follower configuration will not
persist because as noted earlier, no matter how low the prediction error of the follower, 
it will eventually switch on its control. Most of
the time this will not initially increase its prediction error.
However the prediction error of the leader will increase; the leader
will then respond by adjusting his controls, reducing his prediction
error, but increasing that of the &quot;follower&quot;. The follower will in
turn challenge the leader, who loses his leadership role. This chain
of events is full blown competition which can continue for a long
time. Eventually there emerges a clear winner (the agent with the more
complicated goal dynamics) and a clear loser.


The winner-loser configuration is, of course not stable, since on the
average, the loser, who has the larger prediction error, will switch
off his control, returning the system to the leader-follower situation 
in which the loser significantly improves his prediction error.


In the course of the competition each agent will find, by trial and
error, that when it improves a goal dynamics with a complexity greater
than that of the apparent leader, its prediction powers improve as it
assumes a leadership role. On the other hand, the prediction error of
the &quot;new&quot; follower increases sharply when the goal dynamics of the
&quot;new&quot; leader is chaotic; this condition will lead it, in turn, to
shorten the time between two successive trial periods, and make it
likely that the &quot;new&quot; follower becomes active after a short period of
time. Eventually the leader will use a goal dynamics at the edge of
chaos. This configuration is the most stable one, since the follower
no longer find it advantageous to switch on his control. This is
illustrated in Fig.1 *REF*.


Discovering Other Agents


It is natural to ask whether one agent can detect the presence of a
second. If the second is passive, the answer is obviously no. If,
however, that other agent is active, the answer is yes. The strategy
for detection is to switch on a control: if the control works, there
is no other active agent present. If, however, the environment cannot
be entrained to a simple goal dynamics, it is likely that another
agent is already entraining the environment. Our adaptive agents use
this information in the sense that if they detect the other agent and
therefore experience an increase of their prediction error during the
trial period, they become passive. However, if they do not detect
another agent, i.e. improve their prediction error during the trial
period, they become active themselves.


Summary


The adaptive agents we have studied, although following a
comparatively simple strategy, are able to identify regularities,
generalize and compress observed data by using different sets of
schemata and explore strategies to change their environment. We find
that quantitative measures of adaptation in a complex environment,
such as complexity, or the learning rate of the agents, approach
limiting values which depend on the rate of change of the environment
and the noise level in the environment. We hope it is possible to use
these measures to test theoretical predictions experimentally in
physical systems, such as phase locked loops, as well as in economic
systems. In our examination of the co-evolution of two agents we
observe the emergence of leader-follower configurations, in which the
leader entrains the environment to a weakly chaotic dynamics. This
suggests that a primary goal, such as a small prediction error, or a
large return for an investment in an airline company in a highly
competitive market, may cause secondary goals which are chaotic: the
chaotic goal dynamics for the environment in this study or a chaotic
dynamics of the pricing of products such as air fares.


It will be interesting to explore the relationship of the tendency of
the agents to move to the edge of chaos with the general idea of
adaptation to the edge of chaos as discussed by
Langton *REF*, Packard *REF*,
Kauffman *REF*, and Crutchfield *REF*.


It is also interesting to speculate on the applicability to real world
situations of some of the results we have obtained from our toy
model. For example, we have seen that active adaptation, using control
to improve prediction, is under most circumstances the preferred
strategy. This finding seems in accord with experience, whether one is
analyzing the way an infant develops predictive power by exercising
control of its immediate environment (parents) through cries or
smiles, or analyzing the behavior of two interacting adults.
Consider, too, the attempt by traders on a stock market in the early
minutes after the opening, to exercise control and improve their short
term predictive powers, by carrying out a series of trades designed to
probe, actively, likely subsequent trading patterns on that day.


To cite another example; we have seen that in active competition
between agents, the agent with the more complicated strategy will win.
This finding accords with experience on the political scene. It helps
suggest why, for example, the Serbs have proved so successful to
date in pursuing their strategy of ethnic cleansing; their strategy
may be regarded as one involving a series of controlled experiments
which enable them to predict the UN response.


Although the system which we study is simple, it makes possible a
quantitative comparison between numerical and analytical results. We
hope that some of our findings for simple adaptive agents in a chaotic
environment are applicable to the behavior of real adaptive agents in
complicated economic and/or biochemical systems. Of course, to extend
our approach to economic systems it is important to incorporate into
our model the cost of constructing a model, exercising control, etc.
Still, even at the present level, our approach would seem to provide
insight into the success of technical trading systems. Technical
trading systems usually use time bars to describe the spread of values
of a time series, whereas in physics and engineering the variance is
commonly used for that purpose. It can be shown *REF*
that for chaotic time series time bars are maximum likelihood
estimates of the spreading of the data in contrast to the variance. To
the extent that economic time series are chaotic, this could explain
why it is advantageous to use time bars for analyzing their behavior.


We intend in the future to extend in a number of ways the numerical
experiments presented here. We plan to study the competition between
agents of markedly different adaptive capacities ( as manifested both
in the ability to model the environment and to control it) and to
extend our approach to many interacting agents in order to examine
possible collective behavior. While we have seen that the outcome of the present simulations of
the interaction between two agents appears to lead to either a
&quot;win-win&quot; or a &quot;win-lose&quot; situation, we anticipate that the actions of
a powerful maladaptive agent can lead to a &quot;lose-lose&quot; situation,
and it will be interesting to specify the conditions under which this
comes about. As our program is currently written, no matter how well
an agent is doing, it will, over time, seek to improve its predictive
powers by changing its strategy, which means that all the
configurations we have considered are metastable. We therefore plan to
modify our innovation paradigm, Eq.(5) by introducing a threshold for
change; we expect that the resulting &quot;happy agent&quot; configuration may
lead, in some circumstances, to stable &quot;win-win&quot; configurations.
Finally, in order to make more direct contact with economics, we
intend to introduce both a cost of computation and a cost of control
in our numerical experiments.


In another direction, we call the attention of the reader to a closely
related set of independent numerical experiments carried out by
Kaneko and Suzuki *REF* on a model for the evolution
of the complex song of a bird. They use a simple logistic map for the
song dynamics and consider a two person game between competing
&quot;birds&quot;. Their agent &quot;birds&quot; adapt to one another, exercising control
through their songs. Kaneko and Suzuki find that the dynamics of the
complex song evolves toward the edge of chaos. It will be interesting
to explore the relationship between their simulations and our own, and
to see to what extent a complicated environment might play a role in
that evolution.
