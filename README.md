I am planning to study the use of a certain notion of agent in literature in computer science and AI. 
My aim is to build a large corpus that consists of articles that have been published on Arxiv. 
In this repository, I post the various codes that I used to build this corpus. 
All of the codes have been created with the help of GPT-3.5. 
I am not a coder by training. All of the codes have been written for Python. 
My method is based on the work of the Concepts in Motion Group: https://conceptsinmotion.org/
